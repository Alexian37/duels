Kajia_Septie_SalixµµµInfestation |Original | Whenever an opponent moves and switches sides with Kajia (either by his own move or by being pulled, including with Direct Movement), Kajia gives an Insect Counter to that opponent.

Gaspar_GeddonµµµRealities Lost |Original | During the ante step of each beat, Gaspar can ante up to two additional Bases from his hand. Each time he does so, place a Clone Marker in his space or an adjacent space. You cannot place a clone into a space that already contains one of your Clone Markers [or in an opponent's space, see FAQ]. Gaspar's clones will each execute a different one of the additional bases (with no style paired) in priority order during the turn. They always lose priority ties, have -1 Power, and bonuses and penalties applied to Gaspar do not apply to them. When moving, clones move like a character standup would move (jumping over opposing standups), but during the rest of the time they are just Markers. If Gaspar reveals an attack with a Range or Power of N/A, all of his clones are removed from the board and all his anted bases are returned to his hand. Whenever Gaspar is stunned or a beat ends, all clones are removed from the board. When an opponent moves into a space containing a Clone Marker, remove that marker, and its attack does not execute. |µµµPersistent Duality |Alternate Art | Gaspar has two Clone Markers which he places onto the board in the spaces in front of and behind him during setup. Gaspar can ante up to two additional bases from his hand during the ante step.  He can assign each of these bases to one of his Clone Markers. Anted bases recycle with his attack. If he assigns a Clone a base, the Clone performs that attack with -1 Power in priority order (losing all ties with players).  If Gaspar becomes stunned, all his clones become stunned. Clones move just like Standups allied with Gaspar when they are activating an attack, but otherwise they act as Markers.  Standing in the same space as a Clone does not confer any benefits like normal Team Games (such as sharing Stun Guard and Soak). |µµµMy Own Clone |EX | During the ante step of each beat, Gaspar can ante up to two additional Bases from his hand. Each time he does so, place a Clone Marker in his space or an adjacent space. You cannot place a clone into a space that already contains one of your Clone Markers [or in an opponent's space, see FAQ]. Gaspar has an additional full set of normal Bases that he may only use for anteing for his clones. Gaspar's clones will each execute a different one of the additional bases (with no paired Styles) in priority order during the turn. They always lose priority ties, have -1 Power, and bonuses and penalties applied to Gaspar do not apply to them. When moving, clones move like a character standup would move (jumping over opposing stand ups), but during the rest of the time they are just Markers. If Gaspar reveals an attack with a Range or Power of N/A, all of his clones are removed from the board and all his anted bases are returned to his hand. Whenever Gaspar is stunned or a beat ends, all clones are removed from the board. When an opponent moves into a space containing a Clone Marker, remove that marker, and its attack does not execute. |µµµAttack of the Clones |Almighty | During the ante step of each beat, Gaspar can ante up to two additional Bases from his hand. Each time he does so, place a Clone Marker in his space or an adjacent space. You cannot place a clone into a space that already contains one of your Clone Markers [or in an opponent's space, see FAQ]. Gaspar has an additional full set of EX Bases that he may only use for anteing for his clones. Gaspar's clones will each execute a different one of the additional bases (with no paired Styles) in priority order during the turn. They always lose priority ties, have -1 Power, and bonuses and penalties applied to Gaspar do not apply to them.

If Gaspar reveals an attack with a Range or Power of N/A, all of his clones are removed from the board and all his anted bases are returned to his hand. Whenever Gaspar is stunned or a beat ends, all clones are removed from the board. When an opponent moves into a space containing a Clone Marker, remove that marker, and its attack does not execute. |µµµInstanced | +0 | -1 | +1 | This attack has +1 Power for each Base you anted this beat. After Activating: Advance 1 or 2 spaces. |µµµRecursive | +0~1 | -1 | +0 | Gaspar and his clones ignore soak. Gaspar and all of his clones have "On Hit: Pull the opponent up to 1 space." |µµµReplicated | +0 | -1 | +0 | Reveal: If Gaspar anted exactly one base, put his second clone into play in a different space than the first one (just as if he had anted it).

Iaxus_the_ShatteredµµµPlanar Overlay |Original | Iaxus has 5 Plane Cards. He begins with one face up and active. One Growth Counter will be added to the active Plane Card at the beginning of each ante phase, as well as the first time Iaxus takes damage each beat (after all On Damage effects). Whenever a Growth Counter is added to a plane, perform that Plane's Growth effect. When the fifth Growth Counter is added to a Plane, discard the Plane Card and all Growth Counters on it, then perform its Collapse effect instead of its Growth effect. After a Plane collapses, it is removed from the game. A new Plane is chosen to replace it. If an opponent's attack caused the 5th Growth Counter to be placed, that opponent chooses the Plane Card that becomes active. Otherwise, Iaxus chooses a new active Plane. At the end of any beat, if all of Iaxus' Planes are collapsed, he loses the game. |µµµLiving Gate |Alternate Art | Iaxus has 5 Planes, which he sets aside in an ordered stack beside the board. When Iaxus takes damage, he applies that many growth counters to his current plane, then resets his life to 20. Each time a Growth Counter is added to his current plane, Iaxus activates its Growth effect. After adding counters, if a plane has Growth Counters equal to or exceeding 5, discard all Growth Counters, discard the plane, and activate its Collapse effect.  The next plane in his stack immediately becomes active (excess Growth Counters do not move to the new plane). Iaxus is defeat at the End of a Beat if all of his planes have been discarded. |µµµPlanar Form |EX |Iaxus has 5 Plane Cards. He begins with one face up and active. One Growth Counter will be added to the active Plane Card at the beginning of each ante phase, as well as the first time Iaxus takes damage each beat (after all On Damage effects). Whenever a Growth Counter is added to a plane, perform that Plane's Growth effect. When the fifth Growth Counter is added to a Plane, discard the Plane Card and all Growth Counters on it, then perform its Collapse effect instead of its Growth effect. After a Plane collapses, it is removed from the game. A new Plane is chose to replace it. If an opponent's attack caused the 5th Growth Counter to be placed, that opponent chooses the Plane Card that becomes active. Otherwise, Iaxus chooses a new active Plane. At the end of any beat, if all of Iaxus' Planes are collapsed, he loses the game. This is the only way Iaxus can lose the game. |µµµPlanar Soul |Almighty |Iaxus has 5 Plane Cards. He begins with one face up and active. Iaxus must add 1-3 Growth Counters to the active Plane Card at the beginning of each Ante Phase, as well as every time Iaxus is hit during the beat (after all On Damage effects). Once a Growth Counter is added to a plane, perform that Plane's Growth effect. When the 8th Growth Counter is added to a Plane, discard the Plane Card and all Growth Counters on it, then perform its Collapse effect instead of its Growth effect. After a Plane collapses, it is removed from the game. A new Plane is chose to replace it. If an opponent's attack caused the 8th Growth Counter to be placed, that opponent chooses the Plane Card that becomes active. Otherwise, Iaxus chooses a new active Plane. At the end of any beat, if all of Iaxus' Planes are collapsed, he loses the game. This is the only way Iaxus can lose the game. |µµµFolding | +0~1 | +0 | +0 |On Hit: If the opponent is at range 1, move the opponent directly to any space. Otherwise, pull the opponent 1 or 2 spaces. |µµµDiffuse | +0~1 | +0 | +1 | This attack calculates range from the furthest edge of the board from your current position. If both edges are equidistant, this attack calculates range as normal instead. (Calculate range as though you were standing just off the edge of the board.) On Hit: Move the opponent 2 spaces. |µµµSeismic | +0~1 | +1 | -1 |Opponents cannot advance. |µµµExemplary | +1~2 | +1 | -2 | Soak 1, Stun Guard 2 Before Activating: Add a Growth Counter to your current plane. |µµµMinimized | +1~2 | +0 | -1 |Opponents in range of this attack have -2 Power and their attacks do not stun you. |µµµPlane Step |3 |3 |3 | Regardless of style, this attack's Priority is 3 and it wins priority ties.

Kaitlyn_Van_SorrelµµµSpatial Manipulation |Original | As an End of Beat effect, if Kaitlyn was not stunned, she can place one Wormhole Marker onto an unoccupied space on the board.  No more than three of these markers can be in play at a time.  Kaitlyn may remove old markers to place new ones. When a player would move into a Wormhole Marker, remove it instead.  A wormhole marker increases the ranges between players on either side of it by 1.  Kaitlyn may choose to selectively ignore the effects of individual Wormhole Markers when she is moving and calculating range. There are no benefits or penalties when Kaitlyn stands on top of a Wormhole Marker. Note:  Some effects can cause a player to end up standing on a Wormhole Marker (such as ‘swap places’).  [Ed: Swap places does not do this, see FAQ.] Wormhole Markers have no effect when players are standing on them. |µµµSpace Hacker |Alternate Art | Kaitlyn has 3 Wormhole Markers.  She begins a duel with these markers on her starting space, the nearest opponent's starting space, and the center of the board. As an ante, Kaitlyn can move directly to one of these markers (if it is unoccupied by another player) and remove it.  Each time she is hit, she may place a new marker onto any space on the board.  If all of her markers are already on the board in this case, she may remove one to place a new one. |µµµPocket Dimension |EX | As an End of Beat effect, if Kaitlyn was not stunned, she can place one Wormhole Marker onto an unoccupied space on the board.
